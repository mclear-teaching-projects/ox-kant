# The Two-Stem Theory of Mental Representation 

## Fundamental Powers of the Mind[^1]

Receptivity:
:   Power of the mind to receive representations via affection from
    something distinct from itself

Spontaneity:
:   Power of the mind to generate representations from itself without
    any external influence

## The Faculties[^4]

Sensibility:
:   passive/receptive; sensory intuitions arise from the affection of
    sensibility by objects

Understanding:
:   active/spontaneous; conceptual judgments arise via discursive acts
    of the understanding

Reason:
:   active/spontaneous; forms inferences based on judgments given to it by the understanding

## Mental Representation & the Cognitive Ladder (A320/B376-7)[^14]

Representation: 
:  A mental state by means of which the mind is aware of itself or the world[^16]

Sensation: 
:   A perception "which relates to the subject merely as a modification of its state"

Objective representation:
: A conscious representation of a mind-independent (in some sense) feature of
    (empirical) reality

Intuition: 
:   An objective representation which “relates immediately to the object and is singular”

Concept: 
:   An objective representation which is a “mediate [relation to an object], via a mark, which can be common to many things”

# Senses of 'Cognition' #

1. Conscious representation of an object (CPR *Stufenleiter*)
2. Acquaintance with consciousness (JL *Stufenleiter*)[^15]
3. Conscious representation of an object and (at least some of) its general
   features (i.e. properties)

Proper Cognition *[Erkenntnis in eigentlicher Bedeutung]*:
: An objective representation, generated by the cooperation of both faculties,
    and which, in the case of judgment, may "conform with its object"---i.e.
    be true[^22][^23][^12]
    
\newthought{Questions:}
    
1. What distinguishes cognition from knowledge (or other doxastic states)?
2. Is there a general theory of cognition to be had which distinguishes
  intellectual (divine) and discursive (human) cognition as species of some
  unified genus?
3. Is there a privileged sense of 'cognition' internal to Kant's account of
   *discursive* cognition?

# Knowledge 

- Knowledge is a mode of "assent" or "taking to be true" [*Fürwahrhalten*],
  i.e. it is a kind of propositional attitude held on "objective" and
  "subjective" grounds\footnote[][-.95in]{Assent {[}\emph{Furwahrhalten}{]}, or the
  subjective validity of judgment, has the following three stages in relation
  to conviction (which at the same time is valid objectively): having an
  Opinion, Believing, and Knowing. Having an Opinion is Assent with the
  consciousness that it is subjectively as well as objectively insufficient.
  If Assent is only subjectively sufficient and is at the same time held to
  be objectively insufficient, then it is called Believing. Finally, when
  Assent is both subjectively and objectively sufficient it is called
  Knowing. Subjective sufficiency is called conviction (for myself),
  objective sufficiency, certainty (for everyone). I will not pause for
  the exposition of such readily grasped concepts (A822/B850). }
  
\newpage

Ground: 
: that from which something can be cognized (BL 24:42)[^18]
  
Objective Ground:
: that which renders probable the truth of a judgment such that it is:\
     i. publicly valid (CJ 5:467-8)\
     ii. communicable (A820/B848; cf. JL 9:70; 16:390 R2489)\
     iii. holds for all (human) reasoners (LL 24:202; cf. A820/B848; A821/B849; CJ 5:461)\
     
Subjective Ground:
: that which plays an immediate causal role in the subject's psychology to
bring them to assent

Knowledge:
  ~ S’s Assent that *p* counts as Knowledge if and only if there exists
    a ground (*g*) such that:\
     i. *g* is a sufficient objective ground that S has.\
     ii. *g* is part of the (non-deviant) cause of S’s Assent.\
     iii. S is in a position to cite *g* as the sufficient objective
    ground for his Assent, i.e. *g* is cognitively accessible to S\
    iv. *p* is true

## Knowledge vs.  Cognition ##

- Knowledge is an *attitude* (form of assent) towards complex conceptual
  representations (judgments)
- Cognition is a species of *representation*, and may or may not be conceptual
- Cognition is not required for knowledge\footnote[][-1.5in]{knowledge can have
  its grounds in something other than cognition. We might know a proposition
  that refers to a domain of things in either a \emph{wholly negative fashion}
  or a \emph{positive but very general fashion}, for instance, without having
  intuition of those things. In such cases, the objectively sufficient grounds
  of our knowledge \emph{about} those things will be something other than
  cognition of those things. Examples here might include the negative assent
  that the things-in-themselves are not in space and time and the positive but
  very general assent that some thing-in-itself exists and grounds
  appearances. The objectively sufficient grounds of these assents would be,
  on the one hand, Kant's arguments establishing that space and time are
  merely the forms of our receptive sensible intuition, and, on the other
  hand, the inference that there must be some non-spatio-temporal thing that
  is responsible for the ``matter'' of this intuition (see KrV, B XXVI; Prol,
  AA 04: 315). (Chignell 2014, 577)} 
- Cognition need not be assented to
- Cognition may be defective/false[^21]
- Cognition is not obviously warranted/unwarranted


# Accounts of Cognition #

## Watkins & Willaschek[^13] ##

Givenness Condition:
: an object is given iff it is "present to the mind" such that: (i) the cognition is
guaranteed to refer to its object; (ii) makes possible the representation of
the particular object and its features[^24]

- An intuition can refer to its object directly because 
    i. no (objective) representation mediates between the intuitions and its object
    ii. the intuition depends on the object for its existence
- How does an intuition "make possible" the representation of a particular
  without thereby representing its properties (and thus satisfying the thought
  condition)?
 
Thought Condition:
 : the cognition of the object must render that object intelligible; in
 discursive beings this is via the "determination" of the object through
 concepts
 
\newthought{Questions:}

- Is this a plausible general account of cognition?
- Is this account compatible with Kant's view of mathematical cognition in
  particular and a priori cognition more generally?
    - Is the Givenness condition best understood in terms of the *existence* of
      the object of cognition?
- Is there a reason Kant gives for why things as they are in themselves cannot
  be given?

## Schafer[^28]

Real Possibility Constraint:
: Cognition of *X* depends on the degree that we are conscious of its object
as something that is *really possible*[^25]

Determinate Content Constraint: 
: Cognition of *X* depends on the degree to which one of conscious of *X*'s
determinate identity[^26][^27]



## Gomes & Stephenson

- It is both necessary and sufficient for cognition that an intuition be
  brought under a concept[^29] 


<!-- # The Independence of the Stems # -->

<!--     respect to cognition[^10] -->

<!--     independent of the understanding is unclear -->

# Footnotes

[^1]: Our cognition arises from two basic sources of the mind, of which
    the first is to receive the representations (the receptivity of
    impressions), the second the faculty of cognizing an object through
    these representations (spontaneity of concepts); through the first
    an object is given to us, through the second it is thought in
    relation to that representation (as mere determination of the mind).
    (A50/B74)

[^2]: Objects are given to us by means of sensibility, and it alone
    yields us intuitions; they are thought through the understanding,
    and from the understanding arise concepts (A19/B33)

[^3]: That representation which can be given prior to all thinking is
    called intuition (B132)

[^4]: Our nature is so constituted that our intuition can never be other
    than sensible; that is, it contains only the mode in which we are
    affected by objects. The faculty, on the other hand, which enables
    us to think the object of sensible intuition is the understanding.
    To neither of these powers may a preference be given over the other.
    Without sensibility no object would be given to us, without
    understanding no object would be thought. Thoughts without content
    are empty, intuitions without concepts are blind (A51/B75)

[^5]: The genus is representation in general (\emph{representatio}).
    Under it stands the representation with consciousness
    (\emph{perceptio}). A perception that refers to the subject as a
    modification of its state is a sensation (\emph{sensatio}); an
    objective perception is a cognition (\emph{cognitio}). The latter is
    either an intuition or a concept (A320/B377)
    
[^10]: Objects are given to us by means of sensibility, and it alone
    yields us intuitions; they are thought through the understanding,
    and from the understanding arise concepts (A19/B33).

[^11]: If we reflect on our cognitions in regard to the two essentially
    different basic faculties, sensibility and the understanding, from
    which they arise, then here we come upon the distinction between
    intuitions and concepts. Considered in this respect, all our
    cognitions are, namely, either intuitions or concepts. The former
    have their source in sensibility, the faculty of intuitions, the
    latter in the understanding, the faculty of concepts. This is the
    logical distinction between understanding and sensibility, according
    to which the latter provides nothing but intuitions, the former on
    the other hand nothing but concepts. (JL 9:35-6)

[^12]: What is truth? The nominal definition of truth, namely that it is the
    agreement of cognition with its object, is here granted and presupposed;
    but one demands to know what is the general and certain criterion of the
    truth of any cognition. (A58/B82)

[^13]: we take cognition to be a representation that determines a given object
    by attributing general features to it. It thus requires that the object be
    given (givenness condition) and determined, or thought, through concepts
    (thought condition). For human beings, objects can be given only through
    sensibility and thought only by the understanding. [@watkins2017, 84-5]


[^14]: The genus is representation in general (*repraesentatio*). Under it
    stands the representation with consciousness (*perceptio*). A perception
    that refers to the subject as a modification of its state is a sensation
    (*sensatio*); an objective perception is a cognition (*cognitio*). The latter
    is either an intuition or a concept (*intuitus vel conceptus*). The former
    is immediately related to the object and is singular; the latter is
    mediate, by means of a mark, which can be common to several things. (A320/B376-7)

[^15]: In regard to the objective content of our cognition in general, we may
    think the following degrees, in accordance with which cognition can, in
    this respect, be graded: 

    - The first degree of cognition is: to represent something;
    - The second: to represent something with consciousness, or to perceive (*percipere*);
    - The third: to be acquainted with something (*noscere*), or to represent
      something in comparison with other things, both as to sameness and as to
      difference;
    - The fourth: to be acquainted with something with consciousness, i.e., to
      cognize it (*cognoscere*). Animals are acquainted with objects too, but
      they do not cognize them. (JL 9:65)

[^16]: [representation] cannot be explained at all. For we would always have
    to explain what representation is by means of yet another representation.
    (JL 9:34)
 
[^18]: Taking something to be true is an occurrence in our understanding that
    may rest on objective grounds, but that also requires subjective causes in
    the mind of him who judges. If it is valid for everyone merely as long as
    he has reason, then its ground is objectively sufficient, and in that case
    taking something to be true is called **conviction**. If it has its ground
    only in the particular constitution of the subject, then it is called
    **persuasion** (A820/B848)

[^19]: Assent [*Furwahrhalten*], or the subjective validity of judgment, has
       the following three stages in relation to conviction (which at the
       same time is valid objectively): having an Opinion, Believing, and
       Knowing. Having an Opinion is Assent with the consciousness that it is
       subjectively as well as objectively insufficient. If Assent is only
       subjectively sufficient and is at the same time held to be objectively
       insufficient, then it is called Believing. Finally, when Assent is
       both subjectively and objectively sufficient it is called Knowing.
       Subjective sufficiency is called conviction (for myself), objective
       sufficiency, certainty (for everyone). I will not pause for the
       exposition of such readily grasped concepts (A822/B850).

[^20]: knowledge can have its grounds in something other than cognition. We
    might know a proposition that refers to a domain of things in either a
    *wholly negative fashion* or a *positive but very general fashion*, for
    instance, without having intuition of those things. In such cases, the
    objectively sufficient grounds of our knowledge *about* those things will
    be something other than cognition of those things. Examples here might
    include the negative assent that the things-in-themselves are not in space
    and time and the positive but very general assent that some
    thing-in-itself exists and grounds appearances. The objectively sufficient
    grounds of these assents would be, on the one hand, Kant’s arguments
    establishing that space and time are merely the forms of our receptive
    sensible intuition, and, on the other hand, the inference that there must
    be some non-spatio-temporal thing that is responsible for the “matter” of
    this intuition (see KrV, B XXVI; Prol, AA 04: 315). [@chignell2014, 577]

[^21]: a cognition is false if it does not agree with the object to which it
    is related even if it contains something that could well be valid of other
    objects (A58/B83; cf. Meier *Auszug* §92)

[^22]: to bring this synthesis **to concepts** is a function that pertains to
    the understanding, and by means of which it first provides cognition in
    the proper sense (A78/B103)

[^23]: For a representation to be a cognition (though here I mean always a
    theoretical one), we need to have a concept and intuition of an object
    combined in the same representation, so that the former is represented as
    containing the latter under itself. (*Real Progress* (1793) 20:273)

[^24]: an object is given if and only if the object is present to mind so as
    to guarantee that one’s representation refers to it, and to make it
    possible to represent that particular object and (some of) its non-general
    features. [@watkins2017, 89]

[^25]: To *cognize* an object, it is required that I be able to prove its
    possibility (whether by the testimony of experience from its actuality or
    a priori through reason). But I can *think* whatever I like, as long as I do
    not contradict myself, i.e., as long as my concept is a possible thought,
    even if I cannot give any assurance whether or not there is a
    corresponding object somewhere within the sum total of all possibilities.
    (Bxxvi)

[^26]: Understanding is, generally speaking, the faculty of cognitions. These
    consist in the determinate relation of a given representation to an
    object. An object, however, is that in the concept of which the manifold
    of a given intuition is united. (B137) 

[^27]: If we separate [intuitions from concepts], then we have representations
    that we cannot relate to any determinate object (A258/B314)

[^28]: A cognition, then, is a representation that provides the subject with a
    consciousness of its object (or objects) as such. And, in particular, it
    must represent its object (or objects) so as to make us conscious of the
    determinate identity of this object, while also enabling to us show that
    this object is really possible. [@schaferforthcoming, 20]

[^29]: It is clear, then, that intuitions and concepts are each independently
    necessary for cognition “in the proper sense”. We take it, further, that
    they are jointly sufficient: bringing an intuition under a concept
    suffices for cognition. [@gomes2016, 61]
