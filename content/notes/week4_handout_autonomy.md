# The (Non-)Conceptualism Debate

-   Debate about (non-)conceptual content is driven by interest in at
    least the following three issues:

1.  **Acquisition** : How do we acquire the content of that which we
    think, believe, etc.?
2.  **Fixation** : On what basis do we come to hold specific
    (perceptual) beliefs about the world?
3.  **Warrant** : On what basis are our basic (perceptual) beliefs
    about the world warranted?

-   Part of the interest in Kant's views on these matters is that he
    seems to provide an answer to (1)-(3) in terms of experience, and to
    construe experience as nevertheless *fundamentally different in
    kind* than conceptual judgment[^1][^28]
    a)  To what extent does the contemporary debate map issues with which Kant
        is concerned?
    b)  To what extent does the contemporary debate presuppose positions
        that Kant rejects?

# Content

Debate about conceptual vs. non-conceptual content depends on an
antecedent grasp of what content *is*. So what is content?

1.  'Content' as local containment---e.g. the content of a bucket
    -   Mental 'content' as that which is *in* the mind/brain (e.g. 'qualia'
        or 'sense-data')
2.  'Content' as information---e.g. the content of a newspaper article
    -   Mental 'content' as the information possessed by a subject in
        virtue of being in a particular kind of mental state (or
        undergoing a particular kind of mental event)
    -   'Content' in this second sense typically possesses two
        characteristics: 
        a) Content is abstract 
        b) Content is or determines a correctness condition

Content:

:   The condition(s) under which a mental event, state, or process is
    veridical (i.e. accurate/inaccurate, true/false)

The Content View:

: A Perceptual experience presents or conveys information, about the subject's
    environment, to the subject (and so counts as a form of *perception*), in
    virtue of that state's possession of content[^29]

## Concepts

-   To have a concept is typically tied to one's having one or more of the
    following:

    a)  Discriminatory capacities of a particular kind (e.g. the capacity to
        discriminate red from green)
    b)  Recognitional capacities of a particular kind (e.g. both the
        discriminatory capacity and the capacity to designate red things as *red*) 
    c)  Inferential capacities (e.g. capacity to infer *x is colored* from *x
        is red*) 
    d)  Mental particulars with specific causal-functional roles

## Conceptual vs. Non-conceptual Content

-   States with "conceptual content" are states whose content *consists
    of concepts*
    -   Typically, though not always, such states are doxastic states
        (e.g. belief)[^2]
        
Conceptualism:
 :  A perceptual experience whose content is constituted of/by concepts

## Propositional vs. Non-propositional Content

-   Concepts are typically construed as the components of propositions
    (i.e. entities that are true or false, and (typically) the objects
    of doxastic attitudes both within and across persons)
-   Propositions as typically construed as either 'structured' or
    'unstructured'

    1.  Structured propositions
        -   'Russellian' propositions: ordered pairs of objects and
            properties/universals
        -   'Fregean' propositions: structured combinations of concepts
            ('modes of presentation')
    2.  'Unstructured' sets of possible worlds (or functions from worlds to
        truth values)

- Neither "Russellian" propositions nor unstructured propositions have
  conceptual content

# The Kantian Debate #

1.  What is the relevant kantian analogue of a perceptual experience?
2.  Is it correct to think of the relevant kantian analogue of a perceptual
    experience as one with 'content' in the informational sense?
3.   What is it for a representation to be 'conceptual' on Kant's account?
    -   Not a mere discriminatory capacity (non-rational animals have
        those)
    -   Not a mere discriminatory capacity plus an attitude of
        appropriateness (lacks systematicity)
    -   Not a capacity to act in accordance with a rule (what are rules
        if not conceptually structured propositional items?)
    -   Not a capacity to be conscious of a 'unity'
4.  Are all conceptual forms of representation for Kant also
    propositional?[^21][^22]
# Dependence & the Debate

## Terms
    
Objective representation:
:   A conscious representation of a (naïvely) mind-independent feature of
    (empirical) reality

Intellectualism:
:   All objective representation depends, at least in part, on the
    operations of the intellect

Sensibilism:
:   At least some forms of objective representation do not depend on the
    intellect
    
## The Attractions of Intellectualism

-   Kant makes remarks in central texts that are at least suggestive of a
    picture on which *any* cognitive 'relation to an object' depends on acts of
    the understanding

    -   'Relation to an object' is commonly taken by Intellectualism to mean
        representation of a mind-independent feature of reality[^5][^6][^7]
        -  Intellectualism here confuses conditions for objective representation
           with conditions under which something is represented *as* (i.e.
           conceptualized as) "objective" or mind-independent
    -   Intellectualism proposes a strategy to validate the categories---viz.
        they are objectively valid because they are necessary for objective
        representation

## General Problems for Intellectualism

1.   Difficulty making sense of the repeated insistence on the independent
     roles of the two faculties of cognition
2.   Difficulty making sense of Kant's conception of the structure of our
     representation of space and time
3.   Difficulty accounting for the possibility of non-rational animal
     representation
4.   Difficulty accounting for the role non-conceptual representation plays in
     the "construction" of mathematical objects necessary for mathematical
     knowledge
5.   Difficulty accounting for why sense experience provides proof of the
     "real possibility" of the objects of cognition
     
     
## The Mereological Argument Against Intellectualism[^30]

1. The structure of pure intuition is one according to which the parts of the
   representation are determined by the whole
2. The structure of a representation that depends for its generation on an
   intellectual act is one according to which the whole is determined by its
   parts
3. $\therefore$ The pure representations of space and time cannot be dependent
   on intellectual acts for their generation
   
# Positions in the Kantian Debate

## Hanna

-   Sensibility has its own form of spontaneity, which is responsible
    for generating spatial and temporal representations, both pure and
    empirical (intuitions)[^8]

## Allais/McLear/Tolley

-   Sensibility provides representation with a primitive (i.e.
    non-derivative) form of "unity" necessary for generating spatial and
    temporal representations, both pure and empirical, which is
    independent of any synthesis

## Gomes

-   Intuition occurs independently of the intellect, but the occurrence
    of an intuition necessitates (in discursive creatures) a categorial
    synthesis[^9]
    
## Messina

-   The pure representations of space and time are not due to any
    synthesis, but the capacity to generate such representations
    (brutely) depends on the capacity for apperception. Finite pure and
    empirical intuition depends on synthetic activity.[^10]

## Friedman

-   The pure representation of space and time as unitary objects is due
    to a "pre-discursive" intellectual synthesis performed on an
    "aggregate" of possible spatial and temporal perspectives[^11]

## Longuenesse

-   The pure representations of space and time (both as pure forms and
    as "formal" intuitions) are generated by a pre-discursive synthesis
    made possible by the capacity to judge[^12]

## Grüne

-   The pure intuitions of space and time are independent of synthesis,
    but all representations of objects that are phenomenally present to
    the subject, including pure intuitions of finite spatial regions as
    well as all empirical intuitions, depend on sensible synthesis
    carried out by "obscure" (*dunkel*) concepts[^13]

## Ginsborg

-   The occurrence of an intuition with objective representational
    content constitutively depends on a (potential?) consciousness of
    the appropriateness of one's representing as one does[^14]

## Sellars

- Intuitions are forms of conceptual representation, characterized in terms of
  "this-suches", that are contrasted with the purely causal deliverances of
  "sheer receptivity"[^15]

## McDowell

-   The very intelligibility of a faculty of sensibility depends on that
    faculty's engagement of those conceptual capacities distinctive of
    the intellect[^16]

# Footnotes

[^1]: Our nature is so constituted that our intuition can never be other
    than sensible; that is, it contains only the mode in which we are
    affected by objects. The faculty, on the other hand, which enables
    us to think the object of sensible intuition is the understanding.
    To neither of these powers may a preference be given over the other.
    Without sensibility no object would be given to us, without
    understanding no object would be thought … What’s more, these two
    faculties or capacities cannot exchange their functions. The
    understanding is not capable of intuiting anything, and the senses
    are not capable of thinking anything. (A51/B75)

[^2]: Non-conceptual content is not conceptual content, where the latter
    is characterized either as belief content, or as content with
    concepts in the Fregean sense as constituents. [@byrne2005, 233]

[^3]: if we understand by ‘content’ … a representation’s particular
    relation to an object … then it is clear that we should conclude
    that Kant accepts non-conceptual content. This is because Kant
    accepts that intuitions put us in a representational relation to
    objects that is distinct in kind from the relation that pertains to
    concepts. I argued, furthermore, that this is the meaning that Kant
    himself assigns to the term ‘content’. [@tolley2013, 128]

[^4]: Understanding is, generally speaking, the faculty of cognitions.
    These consist in the determinate relation of given representations
    to an object." An object, however, is that in the concept of which
    the manifold of a given intuition is united. Now, however, all
    unification of representations requires unity of consciousness in
    the synthesis of them. Consequently the unity of consciousness is
    that which alone constitutes the relation of representations to an
    object, thus their objective validity, and consequently is that
    which makes them into cognitions...(B137; cf. A104-5)

[^5]: Kant's proposal is that an object is “that in the concept of which
    a manifold of a given intuition is united” (B137). Here ‘object’
    should be read in the broad sense of objective feature of reality —
    a feature whose existence and nature is independent of how it is
    perceived (@pereboom2006, 160)

[^6]: Kant intends still to argue \[in the Transcendental Deduction\]
    that there is some connection between our language, its concepts,
    and the idea of an objective experience. Concepts both exhibit and
    are responsible for what may be called objective features of our
    experience. The notion of a category is that of a concept
    responsible in some way for the objectivity of our experience
    (@bird1962, 130)

[^7]: \[Personal identity and the argument of the TD\] are linked by the
    concept of an objective state of affairs, which Kant, not quite
    happily, calls the concept of an object. This is the concept which
    marks the difference between 'I have a sensation of warmth' and
    'There is something hot in my vicinity'... (@bennett1966, 126)

[^8]: I am construing the sensibility as only relatively passive, but
    not entirely passive (as, e.g. in Locke’s account of sensibility),
    by virtue of its expressing a mental power for spontaneous
    synthesis, or mental processing. This mental power is the ‘power of
    imagination’ (*Einbildungskraft*), and it is delivered in two
    distinct basic stages or moments: (i) a ‘synopsis of the manifold a
    priori through sense’ or ‘synthesis of apprehension’, and (ii) a
    ‘synthesis of this manifold through the imagination’ or ‘synthesis
    of reproduction in imagination’ (CPR A94, A98–102). [@hanna2005,
    249]

[^9]: Kantian intuitions are non-conceptual apprehensions of empirical
    particulars...These relations alone determine the phenomenal character of
    visual experience: hence naïve realism. But when one stands in such a
    relation to empirical particulars, the manifold of intuition is
    synthesised in accordance with the categories in a process governed by the
    understanding. [@gomesforthcoming, 31]

[^10]: the (metaphysical) unity of space is not a brute given. Instead,
    it is necessitated by the OSUA, as is the unity of any sort of
    formal intuition (including the non-spatio-temporal intuitions that
    might be possessed by non-human discursive creatures).
    [@messina2014, 23]

[^11]: I understand the pure form of intuition of space as a mere (not yet
    synthesized) manifold of possible spatial perspectives on possible objects
    of outer sense...The unity of apperception then transforms such a not yet
    uniﬁed manifold into a single unitary space by the requirement that any
    such local perspective must be accessible to the same perceiving subject
    via (continuous) motion—via a (continuous) sequence of translations and
    rotations. [@friedman2015, 290]

[^12]: the space and time described in the Transcendental Aesthetic arc
    products of the figurative synthesis of imagination, and as such are
    what Kant calls, in section 26, formal intuitions.
    [@longuenesse1998, 216]

[^13]: Sensible synthesis is required for relating the qualitative and
    the spatiotemporal content of complex sensible representations to an
    object and making it phenomenally present to the subject. In other
    words, sensible synthesis is required for transforming the
    qualitative and the spatiotemporal content of complex sensible
    representations into intentional content and making this content
    phenomenally present to the subject. [@grune2016a, 88, note 4]

[^14]: that our perceptual experience has representational content in
    the first place is not due to the particular ways that we associate
    our representations, but rather to the consciousness of normativity
    in those associations. [@ginsborg2008, 76]

[^15]: Kant's use of the term 'intuition', in connection with human
    knowledge, blurs the distinction between a special sub-class of
    conceptual representations of individuals which, though in some
    sense a function of receptivity, belong to a framework which is in
    no sense prior to but essentially includes general concepts, and a
    radically different kind of representation of an individual which
    belongs to sheer receptivity and is in no sense conceptual.
    [@sellars1968, 7]

[^16]: We must not suppose that receptivity makes an even notionally
    separable contribution to its co-operation with spontaneity.
    [@mcdowell1996, 41]

[^17]: Objects are given to us by means of sensibility, and it alone yields us
    intuitions; they are thought through the understanding, and from the
    understanding arise concepts. (A19/B33)

[^18]: General logic abstracts from all content (Inhalt) of cognition, i.e.,
    from any relation (Beziehung) of it to the object y (B79)
    
[^19]:[O]uter sense can also contain (*enthalten*) in its representation only
    the relation (*Verhltniß*) of an object to the subject, and not that which is
    internal to the object in itself. It is exactly the same in the case of inner
    sense. (B67)

[^20]: Since no representation pertains to the object immediately (*unmittelbar
    auf den Gegenstand geht*) except intuition alone, a concept is thus never
    immediately related to an object (*niemals auf einen Gegenstand unmittelbar
    bezogen*), but is instead related to another representation of it (whether
    this be an intuition or itself already a concept). (B93; see also B33,
    B41, A109, B376–7; Prolegomena, §8 (4: 281); What Real Progress, 20: 266)

[^21]: [Concepts are] predicates of possible judgment (A69/B94)

[^22]: the understanding can make no other use of these concepts than that of
    judging by means of them. (A68/B93)

[^23]: truth and illusion are not in the object in so far as it is intuited,
    but are in the judgement made about the object in so far as it is thought.
    (A293/B350)

[^24]: all combination is an act of understanding … we cannot represent
    anything as combined in the object without ourselves having combined it
    beforehand; and that, among all representations, combination is the only
    one that cannot be given through objects (B129-30)

[^25]: To cognize an object, it is required that I be able to prove its
    possibility (whether by the testimony of experience from its actuality or
    a priori through reason). But I can think whatever I like, as long as I do
    not contradict myself...(Bxxvi, note)

[^26]: If one...accepts the claim that the function of sensible synthesis is
    to make the objects of intuitions phenomenally present, then one can see
    why according to Kant the formation of the intuition of infinite space and
    infinite time does not presuppose sensible synthesis even though the
    formation of all other intuitions presupposes such a synthesis.
    [@grune2016a, 95-6]

[^27]: Intellectualism$^*$: All representations of objects that are phenomenally
    present to the subject depend on sensible synthesis. [@grune2016a, 88]

[^28]: In contrast [to the pure forms of intuition], the categories of the
    understanding do not at all put forward conditions under which objects in
    intuition can be given to us. Consequently, objects could indeed appear to
    us without their being necessarily related to functions of the
    understanding, and therefore without the understanding containing their
    conditions a priori. (A89/B122; see also A90/B122–3, B132, B145)

[^29]: the Content View can be refined into a proposal that finds the following
    similarity between visual experiences and beliefs: like beliefs, maps, and
    newspapers, visual experiences have contents, and just as the contents of
    beliefs are conditions under which the belief state is true, so the
    contents of experiences are conditions under which the experience is
    accurate. According to this proposal, experiences are the kinds of states
    that can be accurate, and their contents are conditions under which they
    have this status. [@siegel2010, 30]

[^30]: premise (2) of the intellectualist's argument...says that both
    intuition and judgment have a common source of unity—namely, discursive
    activity. If this premise were correct then our cognitive grasp of space
    and time as pure forms of intuition would depend on a discursive form of
    unification, and thus on the combination of their many parts into a unity.
    ...This view entails that our conception of space as an infinite whole
    would be logically constructed from our grasp of the discrete spaces
    composing it... . However, this seems to be precisely what Kant denies
    discursive intellectual activity is able to accomplish. Kant suggests
    instead, in the...Metaphysical Exposition, that our cognitive grasp of
    space is holistic. We grasp the whole of space first, and it is in virtue
    of this that its parts, as limitations of the infinite whole, are
    conceptually grasped and cognized discursively. [@mclear2015, 88]

[^31]: Intellectualism cannot construe intuition as satisfying the Modal
    Condition on anything other than the most general “formal” level.
    Intuition, according to Intellectualism, makes no further contribution to
    determining whether something is really possible according to the specific
    natural laws governing our world. This leaves it a complete mystery as to
    how cases of the actuality of the object, as presented in an occurrent
    intuition, might play any special sort of role in providing the proof
    necessary for cognition. [@mclear2016b, 194]
