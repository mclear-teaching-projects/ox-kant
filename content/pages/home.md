This is the homepage for the Oxford graduate seminar on Kant on Perception &
Cognition taught by [Anil Gomes](http://www.anilgomes.com/)
and [Colin McLear](http://colinmclear.net).

We'll be looking at the general shape of Kant's "critical" philosophical
project as well as specific issues regarding his views concerning the senses
and the intellect. Questions to be considered include the relationship between
cognition and knowledge, the relationship between sensibility and the
intellect, the distinction between introspection and apperception, and the
nature of our awareness of ourselves in inner sense and apperception.

Here is a [syllabus](|filename|/extra/syllabus.pdf) for the class.
