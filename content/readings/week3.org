Our discussion this week concerns the various distinctions Kant makes
between kinds of representation, particularly between intuition, perception,
and experience. He also has two epistemically charged notions--viz. cognition
and knowledge. Here we aim to get as clear as we can concerning what all these
distinctions come to.
