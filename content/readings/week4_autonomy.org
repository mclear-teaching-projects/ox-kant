Kant distinguishes between to basic facultiesâ€”sensibility and the intellect (or
understanding & reason). However, a significant and influential swath of Kant
scholarship nevertheless construes Kant as claiming that basic sensory representations---i.e.
intuitions---are in part dependent on acts of the intellect for their formation. This week
we discuss whether, and to what extent, such claims of dependence could be correct.
