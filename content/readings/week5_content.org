Debate about whether, and to what extent, Kant’s view of sensory experience
construes it as depending on “higher” intellectual forms of representation,
particularly conceptual representation, often remains somewhat unclear as to
what conceptual (and non-conceptual) representation is. This week we try to
figure this out---focusing in particular on both Kant’s explicit statements
about conceptual representation, and their broader connection to Kant’s
characterization of intellectual activity. We’ll then go on to look at whether
it makes sense say that intuition has (non-)conceptual “content” in any relevant
sense.
